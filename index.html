                        Kim Nguyen is a 21 year old Vietnamese American 
                        woman from southern California living in San Francisco, CA at the 
                        time of the creation of this time capsule. She grew up during the 
                        birth of the digital age, thus her online activity is extensively 
                        documented. This will be a collection of her digital interests 
                        and activity. She is a pervasive consumer of media with a special 
                        interest in 2010s television sitcoms and crime shows. Kim is one to 
                        rather rewatch part of a movie she knows she likes rather than starting 
                        a new one. If she's not watching something on one of her various 
                        streaming platforms (Netflix, Hulu, Disney +, HBO Max, none of which 
                        she pays for herself), she's scrolling on her phone. Kim is active 
                        on every major social media app except for Snapchat. She posts
                        her own content the most on Instagram, but she spends the most time 
                        on TikTok. When stressed out, she chooses to scroll through the 
                        mindless, endless feed of TikTok. So, with being a full-time
                        student while also working a part-time job and balancing 
                        a social life...she spends a lot of her free time on TikTok. 
                        Sleep is something that often escapes her.
                        This is a digital time capsule of Fall 2023.
