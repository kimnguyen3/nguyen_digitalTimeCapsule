                Kim Nguyen is a 21 year old Vietnamese American
                <br>
                woman from southern California living in San Francisco, CA at the time
                <br>
                of the creation of this time capsule. She grew up during the 
                birth of the digital age,
                <br>
                thus her online activity is extensively 
                documented. This will be a collection of her digital interests
                <br>
                and activity. She is a pervasive consumer of media with a special interest 
                in 2010s television sitcoms and
                <br>
                crime shows. Kim is one to rather rewatch part of a movie she knows she likes rather 
                than starting a new one. If she's not
                <br>
                watching something on one of her various streaming platforms (Netflix, 
                Hulu, Disney +, HBO Max, none of which she pays
                <br>
                for herself), she's scrolling on her phone. 
                Kim is active on every major social media app except for Snapchat. She posts
                <br>
                her own content the most on Instagram, but she spends the most time on TikTok.
                When stressed out,
                <br>
                she chooses to scroll through the mindless, endless feed of TikTok. So, with being a
                full-time
                <br> 
                student while also working a part-time job and balancing 
                a social life...she spends
                <br>
                a lot of her free time on TikTok. 
                Sleep is something that often escapes her.
                <br>
                This is a time capsule of Fall 2023.
