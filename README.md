# Fall 2023 Time Capsule

by Kimberly Nguyen

# Project Overview

This project is a demonstration of how I have currently learned to use html and css. This site is a preservation of my online interests and activity at the current place and time. 

# Technical Overview

This site consists of one css page linked to each of the four html pages. The fonts Dosis and Play were downloaded from Google Fonts. I created the title icons and the navigation buttons using Adobe Illustrator, while other images were imported from my camera roll or the internet. The Apple Music box is a pre-made embedded code from the Apple Music app. The GIFs were made using the Adobe Express program that converts videos to GIFs.
